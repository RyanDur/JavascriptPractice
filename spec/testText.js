    "%% The Two Aspects\n"+
    "\n"+
    "Below the surface of the machine, the program moves. Without effort,\n"+
    "it expands and contracts. In great harmony, electrons scatter and\n"+
    "regroup. The forms on the monitor are but ripples on the water. The\n"+
    "essence stays invisibly below.\n"+
    "\n"+
    "When the creators built the machine, they put in the processor and the\n"+
    "memory. From these arise the two aspects of the program.\n"+
    "\n"+
    "The aspect of the processor is the active substance. It is called\n"+
    "Control. The aspect of the memory is the passive substance. It is\n"+
    "called Data.\n"+
    "\n"+
    "Data is made of merely bits, yet it takes complex forms. Control\n"+
    "consists only of simple instructions, yet it performs difficult\n"+
    "tasks. From the small and trivial, the large and complex arise.\n"+
    "\n"+
    "The program source is Data. Control arises from it. The Control\n"+
    "proceeds to create new Data. The one is born from the other, the\n"+
    "other is useless without the one. This is the harmonious cycle of\n"+
    "Data and Control.\n"+
    "\n"+
    "Of themselves, Data and Control are without structure. The programmers\n"+
    "of old moulded their programs out of this raw substance. Over time,\n"+
    "the amorphous Data has crystallised into data types, and the chaotic\n"+
    "Control was restricted into control structures and functions.\n"+
    "\n"+
    "%% Short Sayings\n"+
    "\n"+
    "When a student asked Fu-Tzu about the nature of the cycle of Data and\n"+
    "Control, Fu-Tzu replied 'Think of a compiler, compiling itself.'\n"+
    "\n"+
    "A student asked 'The programmers of old used only simple machines and\n"+
    "no programming languages, yet they made beautiful programs. Why do we\n"+
    "use complicated machines and programming languages?'. Fu-Tzu replied\n"+
    "'The builders of old used only sticks and clay, yet they made\n"+
    "beautiful huts.'\n"+
    "\n"+
    "A hermit spent ten years writing a program. 'My program can compute\n"+
    "the motion of the stars on a 286-computer running MS DOS', he proudly\n"+
    "announced. 'Nobody owns a 286-computer or uses MS DOS anymore.',\n"+
    "Fu-Tzu responded.\n"+
    "\n"+
    "Fu-Tzu had written a small program that was full of global state and\n"+
    "dubious shortcuts. Reading it, a student asked 'You warned us against\n"+
    "these techniques, yet I find them in your program. How can this be?'\n"+
    "Fu-Tzu said 'There is no need to fetch a water hose when the house is\n"+
    "not on fire.'{This is not to be read as an encouragement of sloppy\n"+
    "programming, but rather as a warning against neurotic adherence to\n"+
    "rules of thumb.}\n"+
    "\n"+
    "%% Wisdom\n"+
    "\n"+
    "A student was complaining about digital numbers. 'When I take the root\n"+
    "of two and then square it again, the result is already inaccurate!'.\n"+
    "Overhearing him, Fu-Tzu laughed. 'Here is a sheet of paper. Write down\n"+
    "the precise value of the square root of two for me.'\n"+
    "\n"+
    "Fu-Tzu said 'When you cut against the grain of the wood, much strength\n"+
    "is needed. When you program against the grain of a problem, much code\n"+
    "is needed.'\n"+
    "\n"+
    "Tzu-li and Tzu-ssu were boasting about the size of their latest\n"+
    "programs. 'Two-hundred thousand lines', said Tzu-li, 'not counting\n"+
    "comments!'. 'Psah', said Tzu-ssu, 'mine is almost a *million* lines\n"+
    "already.' Fu-Tzu said 'My best program has five hundred lines.'\n"+
    "Hearing this, Tzu-li and Tzu-ssu were enlightened.\n"+
    "\n"+
    "A student had been sitting motionless behind his computer for hours,\n"+
    "frowning darkly. He was trying to write a beautiful solution to a\n"+
    "difficult problem, but could not find the right approach. Fu-Tzu hit\n"+
    "him on the back of his head and shouted '*Type something!*' The student\n"+
    "started writing an ugly solution. After he had finished, he suddenly\n"+
    "understood the beautiful solution.\n"+
    "\n"+
    "%% Progression\n"+
    "\n"+
    "A beginning programmer writes his programs like an ant builds her\n"+
    "hill, one piece at a time, without thought for the bigger structure.\n"+
    "His programs will be like loose sand. They may stand for a while, but\n"+
    "growing too big they fall apart{Referring to the danger of internal\n"+
    "inconsistency and duplicated structure in unorganised code.}.\n"+
    "\n"+
    "Realising this problem, the programmer will start to spend a lot of\n"+
    "time thinking about structure. His programs will be rigidly\n"+
    "structured, like rock sculptures. They are solid, but when they must\n"+
    "change, violence must be done to them{Referring to the fact that\n"+
    "structure tends to put restrictions on the evolution of a program.}.\n"+
    "\n"+
    "The master programmer knows when to apply structure and when to leave\n"+
    "things in their simple form. His programs are like clay, solid yet\n"+
    "malleable.\n"+
    "\n"+
    "%% Language\n"+
    "\n"+
    "When a programming language is created, it is given syntax and\n"+
    "semantics. The syntax describes the form of the program, the semantics\n"+
    "describe the function. When the syntax is beautiful and the semantics\n"+
    "are clear, the program will be like a stately tree. When the syntax is\n"+
    "clumsy and the semantics confusing, the program will be like a bramble\n"+
    "bush.\n"+
    "\n"+
    "    Tzu-ssu was asked to write a program in the language called Java,\n"+
    "which takes a very primitive approach to functions. Every morning, as\n"+
    "he sat down in front of his computer, he started complaining. All day\n"+
    "he cursed, blaming the language for all that went wrong. Fu-Tzu\n"+
    "listened for a while, and then reproached him, saying 'Every language\n"+
    "has its own way. Follow its form, do not try to program as if you\n"+
    "were using another language.'";
